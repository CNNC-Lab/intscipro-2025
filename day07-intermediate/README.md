# Day 7: *Intermediate Programming Concepts*

## Overview
This day covers intermediate programming concepts essential for writing professional, maintainable scientific code. We explore error handling, type hints, documentation standards, object-oriented programming, functional programming patterns, and testing strategies:

1. **Error Handling** - Try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and validation
2. **Type Hints** - Type annotations for better code quality and IDE support
3. **Documentation** - Professional docstrings and code documentation
4. **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, methods, properties, and protocols
5. **Functional Programming** - Map, filter, reduce, and lambda functions
6. **Testing** - Unit testing with pytest, fixtures, and test-driven development

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you will be able to:
- Implement robust error handling with try-except blocks and custom exceptions
- Use type hints to improve code clarity and catch bugs early
- Write professional documentation with NumPy/Google-style docstrings
- Design object-oriented systems with classes, properties, and protocols
- Apply functional programming patterns (map, filter, reduce) to data analysis
- Write comprehensive unit tests using pytest fixtures and parametrization
- Refactor code to follow professional best practices
- Use context managers for resource management
- Implement dataclasses and protocols for clean code architecture
- Build complete analysis pipelines with proper error handling and testing

## Session Structure
The day combines theoretical foundations with extensive hands-on practice. Work through the handout material first, then complete the exercises to reinforce your understanding. All solutions include built-in tests and comprehensive documentation. The bonus challenge integrates all concepts into a complete analysis pipeline.
