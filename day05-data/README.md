# Day 5: *Data Manipulation & Analysis*

## Overview
This day covers essential data manipulation and statistical analysis tools for scientific research. We explore pandas for data handling, cleaning, and transformation, along with SciPy for statistical testing and analysis:

1. **Pandas** - DataFrames, data cleaning, grouping, and reshaping
2. **Data Quality** - Missing data, outliers, and data validation
3. **Statistical Analysis** - Hypothesis testing, correlation, and distribution fitting
4. **Signal Processing** - Filtering, smoothing, and timeseries analysis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you will be able to:
- Load and explore data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Clean data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates
- Transform and create derived variables using pandas operations
- Select and filter data using boolean indexing, .loc[], and .iloc[]
- Group and aggregate data using the split-apply-combine strategy
- Reshape data using pivot tables, melting, and merging operations
- Perform statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, non-parametric)
- Fit and assess probability distributions to empirical data
- Calculate and interpret correlations (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)
- Apply signal processing techniques to timeseries data
- Integrate pandas and SciPy for complete analysis workflows

## Session Structure
The day combines theoretical foundations with extensive hands-on practice. Work through the handout material first, then complete the exercises to reinforce your understanding. Interactive notebooks provide live coding examples. Solutions are provided for self-assessment and learning.
