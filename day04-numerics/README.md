# Day 4: *Numerical Computing Foundations*

## Overview
This day covers the essential numerical computing tools that form the backbone of scientific programming in Python. We explore three fundamental libraries and their applications:

1. **NumPy** - Array computing, linear algebra, and mathematical operations
2. **SciPy** - Scientific computing, statistics, signal processing, and optimization
3. **Matplotlib** - Data visualization and publication-quality figures
