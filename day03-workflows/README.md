# Day 3: *Development Tools & Workflows*

## Overview
This day covers the essential tools and workflows that enable efficient scientific programming and reproducible research. We explore five fundamental topics:

1. **Code Editors and IDEs** - Choosing and using the right development environment
2. **Notebooks & Interactive Programming** - Using Jupyter for exploratory analysis and documentation
3. **Documentation with Markdown and Docstrings** - Writing clear, maintainable documentation
4. **Virtual Environments** - Managing project dependencies and reproducibility
5. **Git Fundamentals and GitHub Workflows** - Version control and collaborative development
6. **Computational Research Workflows** - Best practices for organizing scientific projects

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this day, you will be able to:
- Choose and configure appropriate development tools for scientific programming
- Create and use Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis
- Write effective documentation using Markdown and docstrings
- Set up and manage virtual environments for project isolation
- Use Git for version control and track changes in your code
- Collaborate on projects using GitHub workflows
- Apply best practices for organizing computational research projects

## Session Structure
The day combines theoretical foundations with extensive hands-on practice. Work through the handout material first, then complete the exercises to reinforce your understanding. Solutions are provided for self-assessment and learning.
