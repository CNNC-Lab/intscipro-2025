# Day 6: *Visualization & Communication*

## Overview
This day covers advanced data visualization and scientific communication tools for creating publication-quality figures. We explore three powerful visualization libraries and best practices:

1. **Matplotlib** - Publication-quality static figures, multi-panel layouts, and customization
2. **Seaborn** - Statistical visualization, distribution plots, and categorical analysis
3. **Plotly** - Interactive visualizations, dashboards, and 3D plots
4. **Best Practices** - Color accessibility, figure design, and export formats

## Practical Exercises
- **Exercise Set**: [day06_exercises.md](day06_exercises.md) (also available as pdf from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWS1VzzT6OjsqF4rMO2mhq9w-hbdMtGG/view?usp=sharing)) - Hands-on exercises covering:
  - Multi-panel publication figures with Matplotlib
  - Statistical comparisons with Seaborn
  - Interactive dashboards with Plotly
  - Fixing common visualization mistakes
  - Multi-dimensional data exploration
  - Time series visualization
  - Creating custom figure style templates

## Solutions
Complete solutions are provided in a separate notebook [`day06_solutions.ipynb`](notebooks/day06_solutions.ipynb).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you will be able to:
- Create publication-quality figures with Matplotlib using object-oriented interface
- Design multi-panel layouts with subplots and GridSpec
- Use Seaborn for statistical visualization (distributions, categorical, relationships)
- Build interactive visualizations with Plotly Express and Graph Objects
- Apply colorblind-safe color palettes and accessibility best practices
- Export figures in appropriate formats (PDF, PNG, SVG, HTML)
- Customize figure styling with rcParams and style sheets
- Create FacetGrids for conditional visualization
- Build 3D interactive visualizations for high-dimensional data
- Identify and fix common visualization mistakes

## Session Structure
The day combines theoretical foundations with extensive hands-on practice. Work through the handout material first, then complete the exercises to reinforce your understanding. Interactive notebooks provide live coding examples. Solutions are provided for self-assessment and learning.
