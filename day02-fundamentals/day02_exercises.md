> - Save your work in appropriately named files (e.g., `ex1.py`, `ex2.py`)
> - Don't hesitate to use `help()` or `dir()` to explore Python's capabilities
> - Search online for documentation, but try not to use LLMs; it is important to understand these principles
---
## **Part 1**: Variables, Data Types, and Basic I/O
### Exercise 1: *Value and Type of Expressions*
Using your Python interpreter (interactive mode or a script), check the value and type of the following expressions and determine which cause errors.

First, define these variables:
```python
i = 10
j = 3
f = 3.0
c = 4.0 + 3.5j
s = 'hello'
```

Now evaluate each of the following expressions. For each one:
- Predict what will happen
- Execute the code
- Check the result and its type using `type()`
- Explain why you got that result

**Expressions to test:**
```python
2 * i
i + f
s + ' world'
s + i
s + str(i)
i / j
i / float(j)
i / f
i // j
i // f
c * f
f ** 2
i ** 0.5
```


> [!question] **Questions:**
> 1. What happens when you combine an `int` and a `float` in arithmetic operations? What type is the result? Is this sensible?
> 
> 2. What's the difference between `/` (true division) and `//` (floor division)?
> 
> 3. What happens when you try to add a string and a number? How can you fix this?
> 
> 4. Can you perform arithmetic with complex numbers? What operations work?
---
### Exercise 2: *Understanding Variables and Identity*
#### Part a) Same or Different?
Examine these two programs carefully. What is the difference in their behavior, and why does it happen?
**Program 1:**
```python
x = 'ab'
y = x
x = 'ac'
print(y)
```
**Program 2:**
```python
x = ['a', 'b']
y = x
x[1] = 'c'
print(y)
```

> [!question] **Questions:**
> 1. What does each program print?
> 2. Why do they behave differently?
> 3. What does this tell you about how Python handles strings vs. lists?
> 4. How would you modify Program 2 to make `y` independent of `x`?

**Hint:** Use `id()` to check object identity, and read about mutable vs. immutable types.
#### Part b) Swapping Values
Write a Python program that swaps the values of two variables. For example:
```python
a = 10
b = 20
# TODO Your code here
# After your code runs:
# a should be 20
# b should be 10
```
Try to find at least two different ways to accomplish this swap.

---
### Exercise 3: *List and String Slicing*
**Save your solution in a file named `ex3.py`**

Define the following variables:
```python
mystring = '012345678'
mylist = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']
```
Use slicing to perform the following operations. For each, print the result to verify it worked.

1. Set variable `a` to be the first five characters of `mystring`

2. Set variable `b` to be everything except the first five characters of `mystring`

3. Set variable `c` to be everything from the second character until the next-to-last character of `mystring`

4. Set the 3rd item in `mylist` to the last value of `mystring`, then print `mylist`

5. Try to set the 3rd item in `mystring` to the last value of `mylist`, then print `mystring`. **What happens? Why?** How can you achieve the same result?

6. Set a variable `d` to be every second item of `mylist`

7. Set a variable `e` to be every item of `mylist` in reverse order

8. **Challenge:** Extract the middle three items from `mylist` using slicing

> [!question] **Questions to consider:**
> - Why can you modify list elements but not string characters?
> - What's the difference between mutable and immutable types?
> - How does negative indexing work?
---
### Exercise 4: *Input and Output*
#### Part a) Writing to Screen
**Save as `ex4a.py`**

Write a Python program that:
1. Prints your name
2. Prints your research interest or favorite scientific topic
3. Uses f-strings to create a formatted message combining both

Example output:
```
Name: Ana Silva
Research interest: Synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons
Hello! I'm Ana Silva and I study synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons.
```
#### Part b) Reading Input
**Save as `ex4b.py`**

Write a program that:
1. Asks the user for their first name
2. Asks for their last name
3. Prints a personalized greeting

Example interaction:
```
Enter your first name: Carlos
Enter your last name: Santos
Hello, Carlos Santos! Welcome to the scientific programming course.
```
#### Part c) Reading Numeric Input
**Save as `ex4c.py`**

Write a program that:
1. Asks the user for their age
2. Converts the input to an integer
3. Calculates how many years until they turn 100
4. Prints an appropriate message

**Challenge:** Add error handling for non-numeric input. 

---
### Exercise 5: *Temperature Conversion*
**Save as `ex5.py`**

Write a program that asks the user for a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit.

**Formula:** °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Example interaction:
```
Enter temperature in Celsius: 37
37.0°C is equal to 98.6°F
```

**Extensions:**
1. Format the output to 1 decimal place

2. Allow the user to choose which direction to convert (C to F or F to C)

3. Add input validation to ensure the temperature is reasonable (e.g., above absolute zero: -273.15°C)
---
### Exercise 6: *Discovering Python's Capabilities*
#### Part a) Exploring Lists
**Save as `ex6a.py`**

Start by defining a non-empty list of your choice (e.g., neuron types, brain regions, or experimental conditions).

Your task is to discover and use the following list methods **without looking them up** (use `dir()` and `help()`):
1. Add an element to the end of the list
2. Remove the last element you added
3. Remove the first element from the list
4. Insert an element at a specific position
5. Find the index of a specific element
6. Count how many times an element appears
7. Sort the list

**Example starting point:**
```python
brain_regions = ["cortex", "hippocampus", "cerebellum"]

# Use dir(brain_regions) to see available methods
# Use help(brain_regions.append) to learn about specific methods
```
**Bonus:** What's the difference between `sort()` and `sorted()`?
#### Part b) Exploring Strings
**Save as `ex6b.py`**

Write a program that:
1. Reads the user's first name and last name (as a single input: "firstname lastname")
2. Reverses the order to "lastname, firstname"

**Discover and use string methods for:**
- Splitting a string into parts
- Joining strings together
- Capitalizing text

Example interaction:
```
Enter your full name: maria santos
Output: Santos, Maria
```

**Extensions:**
- Handle middle names
- Handle unusual capitalization in input
- Discover what `strip()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, and `title()` do
---
## **Part 2**: Operators, Expressions, and Control Structures
### Exercise 7: *Arithmetic Operations on Different Types*
**Save as `ex7.py`**
#### Part a) Type Mixing
Write a program that tests what happens when you combine different numeric types:
```python
a = 2       # int
b = 3.75    # float

# Test these operations:
c = a + b
d = a - b
e = a * b
f = a / b
g = a // b
h = a % b
i = a ** b

# For each result, print:
# 1. The result value
# 2. The result type
# 3. Whether it makes sense
```

> [!question] **Questions:**
> - What type does each operation return?
> - Is Python's behavior sensible?
> - When might you want to explicitly convert types?
#### Part b) Division Behavior
Test the division operator's behavior with different types:
```python
# Test these:
10 / 3       # float division
10 // 3      # floor division (int)
10.0 // 3.0  # floor division (float)
10 % 3       # modulo (remainder)
```

> [!question] **Questions:**
> - What's the difference between `/` and `//`?
> - Why does `10.0 // 3.0` return a float?
> - When would you use `%` (modulo)?
#### Part c) Modulo Applications
The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of division.

Write code to:
1. Check if a number is even or odd
2. Check if number `a` is a factor of number `b` (divides evenly)
3. Extract the last digit of a number
4. Convert seconds to minutes and seconds

Example for task 4:
```python
total_seconds = 185
minutes = ?
seconds = ?
# Should give: 3 minutes and 5 seconds
```
---
### Exercise 8: *Logical Expressions and Comparisons*
**Save as `ex8.py`**
#### Part a) Boolean Logic
Predict the result of these expressions, then verify:
```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = 5

# Predict then test:
x < y
x == z
x <= z
y != z
x < y and y > z
x < y or y < z
not (x == z)
x < y < 15
```
#### Part b) Chained Comparisons
Python allows chained comparisons. Test these:
```python
age = 25

# Traditional way:
result1 = age >= 18 and age < 30

# Chained comparison:
result2 = 18 <= age < 30

# Test with different ages:
# 15, 18, 25, 30, 35
```
#### Part c) Neuroscience Application
Write expressions to check if:
1. A membrane potential is in the depolarization range (-55 mV to -30 mV)
2. A firing rate is abnormally high (>100 Hz) or low (<1 Hz)
3. An experiment is valid (has consent AND age >= 18 AND no exclusion criteria)

```python
voltage = -45
firing_rate = 12.5
has_consent = True
age = 22
has_exclusion = False

# Write boolean expressions for each condition
```
---
### Exercise 9: *Warming Up with Loops*
#### Part a) For-Loop Sum
**Save as `ex9a.py`**

Write a program with a for-loop that adds up all whole numbers between 1 and 100 and prints the total.

**Expected output:** 5050

**Extension:** Verify your result using the formula: sum = n(n+1)/2 where n=100

#### Part b) While-Loop Sum
**Save as `ex9b.py`**

Write a program with a while-loop that:
1. Starts at 1 and adds consecutive numbers
2. Stops when the total exceeds 1000
3. Prints the number at which this happens and the final total

**Extension:** How many numbers did it take? Print this information.

#### Part c) Nested Loops
**Save as `ex9c.py`**

Write a program using nested loops to create a multiplication table from 1 to 10.

Example output:
```
1 x 1 = 1    1 x 2 = 2    1 x 3 = 3    ...
2 x 1 = 2    2 x 2 = 4    2 x 3 = 6    ...
...
```

**Extension:** Format the output nicely with aligned columns.

---
### Exercise 10: *Function Analysis with Loops*
**Save as `ex10.py`**

**Important:** Start your program with:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

We will study these libraries in detail later on, but for now, we need some of the functionality they provide, namely:
- Create ranges of floats: `x_data = np.arange(start, stop, step)`
- Plot data: `plt.plot(x_data, y_data)`
- Display the plot: `plt.show()`
#### Part a) Calculate and Display a Function

Write a program that:
1. Calculates y = x² - 2x from x = -5 to x = 5 in steps of 0.1
2. Stores x values in one list and y values in another
3. Plots y against x
4. Displays the plot

**Hints:**
- Use `np.arange(-5.0, 5.1, 0.1)` for x values
- Create an empty list for y values
- Use a for-loop to calculate each y value
- Append y values to your list
#### Part b) Finding a Root
A **root** of an equation y = f(x) is a value of x where y = 0.

Modify your program from part a to find and print the first root (where y changes from positive to negative or vice versa).

**Approach:**
- Loop through your y values
- Check if consecutive values have opposite signs
- Print the corresponding x value

**Hint:** You'll need to compare `y_values[i]` with `y_values[i-1]`
#### Part c) Finding All Roots (\*)
Adapt your solution to find **all** roots in the range, not just the first one.

**Extension:** Print both roots and indicate whether each is a crossing from positive-to-negative or negative-to-positive.

#### Part d) Calculating the Derivative (\*)
The derivative of a function can be approximated by:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} ≈ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{(y[i+1] - y[i])}{(x[i+1] - x[i])}$$

Add code to:
1. Calculate the derivative at each point
2. Plot both the original function and its derivative
3. Observe where the derivative crosses zero - what does this mean?

**Hint:** The derivative list will have one fewer element than the original function.

---
### Exercise 11: *Area Under a Curve (Numerical Integration. \*)*
**Save as `ex11.py`**

We'll approximate the area under a curve by dividing it into rectangles - this is called the **Riemann sum**.

Start with:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
#### Part a) Visualizing the Riemann Sum

Write a program that:
1. Calculates y = exp(x) from x = 0 to x = 4 with step size 0.1
2. Plots the function as a line
3. Uses `plt.bar()` to display rectangles with:
   - Width: 0.1 (your step size)
   - Height: exp(x) at each point
   - Position: each x value

The bars should approximate the area under the curve.

**Hint:**
```python
x_values = np.arange(0.0, 4.0, 0.1)
y_values = np.exp(x_values)
plt.bar(x_values, y_values, width=0.1)
plt.show()
```

#### Part b) Calculating the Total Area
Modify your program to calculate the total area of all rectangles.

**Formula:** Total area = Σ (height × width) = Σ (y_i × Δx)

Use a for-loop to sum up the areas of all rectangles and print the result.

**Note:** This approximates the following integral:  $\int_{0}^{4} \exp(x) \, dx$

#### Part c) Finding the Upper Limit
Write a program that adds up rectangles under y = exp(x) until the total area exceeds 25.

Print:
1. The x value where this happens
2. The total area

**Hint:** Use a while-loop instead of a for-loop.

#### Part d) Alternative Implementations (\*)
You probably used a for-loop for part b and a while-loop for part c.

**Challenge:** 
- Implement part b using a while-loop
- Implement part c using a for-loop with `break`

Which approach is more natural for each problem? Why?

**What you just did:**
1. You approximated the integral:
$$
\int_{0}^{a} \exp(x) \, dx \approx \sum \exp(x) \Delta x
$$
where Δx = 0.1 and a = 4.0 (or the upper limit you found).
2. In part c, you found the value of `a` such that $\int_{0}^{a} \exp(x) \, dx = 25$.

This is a fundamental technique in numerical analysis!

### Exercise 12: *Control Flow Mastery*
**Save as `ex12.py`**
#### Part a) Grade Calculator
Write a program that:
1. Asks the user for a numerical score (0-100)
2. Prints the corresponding letter grade using this scale:
   - A: 90-100
   - B: 80-89
   - C: 70-79
   - D: 60-69
   - F: 0-59

Use if-elif-else statements.
#### Part b) Spike Train Classifier
Write a program that classifies neural firing patterns:
```python
firing_rate = float(input("Enter firing rate (Hz): "))

# Classify as:
# "Silent" if rate < 1
# "Low" if 1 <= rate < 10
# "Moderate" if 10 <= rate < 50
# "High" if 50 <= rate < 100
# "Hyperactive" if rate >= 100
```
#### Part c) Password Validator (\*)
Write a program that validates a password must meet these criteria:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least one digit
- Contains at least one uppercase letter

Give the user 3 attempts. If they succeed, print "Password accepted". If they fail all attempts, print "Too many failed attempts".

> [!hint] **Hints:**
> - Use string methods: `isdigit()`, `isupper()`, `islower()`
> - Use `any()` function with a loop or list comprehension
> - Use a for-loop with a counter or a while-loop
> 
---
### Exercise 13: *Exception Handling*
**Save as `ex13.py`**
#### Part a) Safe Division
Write a program that:
1. Asks for two numbers
2. Divides the first by the second
3. Handles both ValueError (non-numeric input) and ZeroDivisionError

Example interaction:
```
Enter numerator: 10
Enter denominator: 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!

Enter numerator: 10
Enter denominator: abc
Error: Please enter a valid number!

Enter numerator: 10
Enter denominator: 2
Result: 5.0
```

#### Part b) Robust Age Input

Write a program that repeatedly asks for the user's age until valid input is received:
- Must be a number
- Must be positive
- Must be less than 120

Use try-except with a while loop.

#### Part c) File-Safe Calculator (\*)

Create a calculator that:
1. Performs basic operations (+, -, *, /)
2. Handles all possible errors gracefully
3. Keeps running until user types "quit"

Example:
```
Enter calculation (or 'quit'): 10 + 5
Result: 15.0

Enter calculation (or 'quit'): 10 / 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!

Enter calculation (or 'quit'): 10 * abc
Error: Invalid number!

Enter calculation (or 'quit'): quit
Goodbye!
```

## **Part 3**: Functions and Modular Programming

### Exercise 14: *Function Fundamentals*

#### Part a) From Loop to Function

**Step 1:** Write a program with a for-loop that adds up the squares of all whole numbers between 1 and 20.

```python
# TODO Your for-loop here
```

**Step 2:** Turn your answer into a function called `sum_of_squares()` that returns the sum of squares from 1 to 20.

```python
def sum_of_squares():
    # TODO Your code here
    pass

result = sum_of_squares()
print(f"Sum of squares from 1 to 20: {result}")
```

**Step 3:** Modify your function to accept a parameter `n` and calculate the sum of squares from 1 to n.

```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    # TODO Your code here
    pass

print(sum_of_squares(20))   # Should give same result as before
print(sum_of_squares(10))   # Should give 385
```
#### Part b) While-Loop Function

**Step 1:** Write a program with a while-loop that adds up squares of whole numbers starting from 1 until the total exceeds 10000.

**Step 2:** Turn this into a function `find_threshold()` that returns the number at which the threshold is exceeded.

**Step 3:** Modify to accept a parameter `threshold` (replacing the hardcoded 10000).

```python
def find_threshold(threshold):
    # TODO Your code here
    pass

print(find_threshold(10000))
print(find_threshold(1000))
print(find_threshold(100))
```

#### Part c) Input Validation

Modify your `find_threshold()` function to:
1. Check if the input is an integer
2. Check if the input is positive
3. Print an error message and return None if invalid

```python
def find_threshold(threshold):
    # TODO Add input validation here
    
    if not isinstance(threshold, int):
        print("Error: threshold must be an integer")
        return None
    
    if threshold <= 0:
        print("Error: threshold must be positive")
        return None
    
    # Original code here
    pass
```

    pass

# Test with different bounds:
print(riemann_sum(0, 4))
print(riemann_sum(1, 3))
print(riemann_sum(-1, 1))
```

#### Part c) Default Step Size

    """
    # TODO Your code here
    pass

# Test with different step sizes:
print(riemann_sum(0, 4))           # Uses default step
print(riemann_sum(0, 4, step=0.01))  # Finer steps
print(riemann_sum(0, 4, step=0.5))   # Coarser steps
```

#### Part d) Generic Function Integration (\*)

    """Calculate x² - 2x"""
    return x**2 - 2*x

def exponential(x):
    """Calculate exp(x)"""
    return np.exp(x)

# Test with different functions:
print(riemann_sum(exponential, 0, 4))
print(riemann_sum(quadratic, 0, 2))
print(riemann_sum(np.sin, 0, np.pi))  # sin from 0 to π should be ~2

### Exercise 17: *Recursive Functions* (\*)
**Save as `ex17.py`**

Recursion is when a function calls itself. Every recursive function needs:
1. A base case (when to stop)
2. A recursive case (calling itself with a simpler problem)
#### Part a) Factorial
Write a recursive function to calculate factorial:
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate n! recursively.
    
    n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    n : int
        Non-negative integer
    
    Returns:
    --------
    int
        n!
    """
    # Base case: 0! = 1 and 1! = 1
    
    # Recursive case: n! = n × (n-1)!
    
    pass

# Test:
print(factorial(5))   # Should be 120
print(factorial(0))   # Should be 1
```

#### Part b) Fibonacci
Write a recursive function for the Fibonacci sequence:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
    
    Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    n : int
        Position in sequence (0-indexed)
    
    Returns:
    --------
    int
        nth Fibonacci number
    """
    # Base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    
    # Recursive case: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
    
    pass

# Test:
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
```
#### Part c) List Sum
Write a recursive function to sum all numbers in a list:
```python
def recursive_sum(numbers):
    """
    Sum all numbers in a list recursively.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    numbers : list
        List of numbers
    
    Returns:
    --------
    float
        Sum of all numbers
    """
    # Base case: empty list sums to 0
    
    # Recursive case: sum = first element + sum of rest
    
    pass

# Test:
print(recursive_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Should be 15
print(recursive_sum([]))                # Should be 0
```
---
### Exercise 18: *Scope and Namespace* (\*)
**Save as `ex18.py`**
#### Part a) Understanding Scope
Predict the output of this program, then run it:
```python
x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "outer"
    
    def inner():
        x = "inner"
        print(f"Inner x: {x}")
    
    inner()
    print(f"Outer x: {x}")

outer()
print(f"Global x: {x}")
```
#### Part b) Modifying Global Variables
Fix this code so it correctly increments the counter:
```python
counter = 0

def increment():
    # This doesn't work - why?
    counter = counter + 1

increment()
print(counter)  # Still 0!
```

**Two solutions:**
1. Use the `global` keyword (not recommended)
2. Return the new value and reassign (recommended)
#### Part c) Function Closures
Study this code and explain what happens:
```python
def make_multiplier(factor):
    """Create a function that multiplies by factor."""
    def multiply(x):
        return x * factor
    return multiply

times_two = make_multiplier(2)
times_ten = make_multiplier(10)

print(times_two(5))   # ?
print(times_ten(5))   # ?
```

## Challenge Problems

### Challenge 1: *Prime Number Generator*
Write a function that generates all prime numbers up to n using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). Include a progress indicator for large n.
### Challenge 2: *Monte Carlo Pi Estimation*
Estimate $\pi$ using the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method):
1. Generate random points in a unit square
2. Count how many fall inside a quarter circle
3. Use the ratio to estimate $\pi$
### Challenge 3: Spike Train Simulation
Write a function that simulates a Poisson spike train given a firing rate and duration. Return a list of spike times.

> [!hint] **Tips for Debugging**
> 1. **Print statements are your friend**: Add `print()` statements to see variable values
> 2. **Test incrementally**: Don't write everything at once
> 3. **Use meaningful names**: `spike_count` is better than `sc` or `x`
> 4. **Check types**: Use `type()` to verify variable types
> 5. **Read error messages carefully**: They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
> 6. **Use the debugger**: Learn to use Python's `pdb` debugger
> 7. **Ask for help**: Discuss with classmates and instructors
