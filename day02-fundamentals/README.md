# Day 2: *Programming Fundamentals*

## Overview
This day covers the essential building blocks of Python programming that form the foundation for all scientific computing. We explore three fundamental topics:

1. **Variables, Data Structures, and Basic I/O** - How to store and organize data effectively
2. **Operators, Expressions, and Control Structures** - How to manipulate data and control program flow  
3. **Functions and Modular Programming** - How to organize code into reusable, maintainable components

## Lecture Materials
- **Slides**: Available from [this link](https://slides.com/renatocfduarte/sci-pro2/scroll?token=vGNyExFb&chrome=hidden) (download as HTML)

## Practical Exercises
- **Exercise Set**: [day02_exercises.md](day02_exercises.md) (also available as pdf from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18r-yc6AXCjlAtKIHI3ColImFw4EcRNF7/view?usp=drive_link)) - 18 hands-on exercises covering:
  - Variables, data types, and basic I/O operations
  - Operators, expressions, and control flow structures
  - Functions, scope, and modular programming principles
- **Solutions**: Complete solutions available in [day02_solutions/](day02_solutions/) directory

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this day, you will be able to:
- Create and manipulate variables of different data types
- Use Python's built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- Write conditional statements and loops to control program flow
- Define and use functions with parameters and return values
- Understand variable scope and namespace concepts
- Apply modular programming principles to organize code effectively

## Session Structure
The day combines theoretical foundations with extensive hands-on practice. Work through the handout material first, then complete the exercises to reinforce your understanding. Solutions are provided for self-assessment and learning.
