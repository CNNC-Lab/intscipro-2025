## Steps

### Step 1: Data Loading and Validation
Load the datasets/complex_behavioral_data.csv file and perform comprehensive validation:
- Check for missing values and data integrity
- Verify column formats and ranges
- Create data quality report
- Generate basic descriptive statistics

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Transform the raw data for analysis:
- Create derived variables (learning_trial, normalized_rt, accuracy_rolling, session_progress)
- Handle any outliers or anomalous data points
- Prepare data structures for statistical modeling
- Generate exploratory visualizations

### Step 3: Primary Analysis - Learning Performance
Analyze the core research questions:
- Compare accuracy and response times between WT and KO genotypes
- Model learning curves using appropriate statistical approaches
- Identify optimal performance levels and time-to-criterion
- Generate publication-quality figures showing genotype differences

### Step 4: Stimulus Modality Analysis
Examine performance across different stimulus types:
- Compare visual, auditory, and tactile stimulus performance
- Test for genotype Ã— stimulus interactions
- Analyze difficulty effects within each modality
- Create comprehensive visualization of stimulus effects

### Step 5: Temporal Dynamics Investigation
Model changes over time and sessions:
- Within-session performance changes (fatigue, warm-up effects)
- Between-session retention analysis
- Track motivation and stress changes across days
- Investigate reward magnitude effects on sustained performance

### Step 6: Statistical Modeling
Implement appropriate statistical frameworks:
- Fit mixed-effects models accounting for repeated measures
- Use logistic regression for accuracy data with proper random effects
- Model response times with appropriate distributions
- Perform model selection and validation

### Step 7: Advanced Analytics
Apply sophisticated analytical approaches:
- Individual differences clustering analysis
- Machine learning prediction of genotype from behavioral patterns
- Time series analysis for learning transitions
- Generate comprehensive results summary

### Step 8: Visualization and Reporting
Create publication-ready outputs:
- Generate all figures at 300 DPI resolution
- Create comprehensive statistical results tables
- Produce executive summary of key findings
- Organize code in well-documented, reproducible format
